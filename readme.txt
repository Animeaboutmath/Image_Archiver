Image Archive-o-matic 0.1

Purpose: 
This is a very small, informal script written in python that is utilized to save copies of images locally in more managed sizes that are storage friendly. 
The tool is largely used as a resource to archive images in such a way that reduces storage requirements/cost.

Requirements:
- Python3
Addon Libraries:
- Pillow
- Requests

Usage: 
Pass the associated script into python, like via CMD: python3 image-archive.py

By copying URLs into the input bar, you can cache a local copy of a file. There's no expectation that the file saved will be of the highest quality, there's other tools for that. Instead, this tool prioritizes compressing and storing files, as it's intended to help mass-archive photos (Art is culture after all). I've on average been able to get files that are ~80% smaller than their uncompressed jpeg counterpart. This tool also supports CSV uploads of URLs, please refer to sample.csv for a test file.
